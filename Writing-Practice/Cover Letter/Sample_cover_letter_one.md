Dear Mr. Robinson,

I am excited to be applying for the Lead Digital Marketing position at Aquitaine Media Strategies advertised on Indeed.com on 30 April. I am a passionate email marketing specialist with three years of professional experience doing market research and gathering testing statistics. I am confident that I will be able to contribute to your team’s success at Aquitaine Media Strategies. 

Your job announcement mentions you need someone knowledgeable in campaign development and statistics collecting, both of which happen to be areas I have experience in.  I am currently working at Electronic Arts, where I have led a digital promotion campaign for the company’s new simulation game, BigCity 4, that has improved our sales by 35%. 

My proven success in creating highly effective solutions to achieve e-commerce objectives and acquiring new customers on platforms such as websites and mobile applications makes me a valuable asset at Aquitaine Media Strategies.  

I look forward to discussing the Lead Digital Marketing position as well as my qualifications with you in more detail. You can contact me at your earliest convenience. I will contact you next Monday to make sure you have received my application.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,

Felicity Beauchcamps
