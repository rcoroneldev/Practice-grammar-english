Dear Mr. Corben,

I am excited to be applying for the Lead Digital Marketing position at Aquitaine Media Strategies advertised in Indeed.com on 30 April. As a passionate email marketing specialist with three years of professional experience doing market research, and gathering A/B testing statistics in order to drive successful marketing campaigns, I am confident that I will be really able to contribute to your team’s success at Aquitaine Media Strategies. 

Your advertisement mentions you need someone knowledgeable in campaign development and A/B testing, both of which happen to be areas I have experience in.  I am currently working at Electronic Arts, where I have led a digital promotion campaign for the company’s new simulation game, BigCity 4, that has improved our sales by a 35% immediately upon its release. 

My proven track record in creating highly effective solutions to achieve e-commerce objectives and stimulating new customer acquisition across platforms such as websites and mobile applications makes me a valuable asset at Aquitaine Media Strategies.  

I look forward to discussing the Lead Digital Marketing position as well as my qualifications with you in more detail. You can contact me at your earliest convenience. I will contact you next Monday to make sure you have received my application.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,

Lauriane Roussillon
