Write two or three paragraphs.In this blog, I will share my experience of the best day. Two years ago.I decided to study for a master’s degree
in data science. I think that was difficult to choose which master’s should study. I had to research different fields such as cloud computing, and big data. 
So, I decided to study for a master’s in data science.After that, I needed to choose the specialization. According to my experience in decided in
data analytics. In this master’s degree, I have learned a lot about many topics related to data science. Besides,
I made networking with many people. I started to study in the year 2021. The duration of this master’s degree was for two years. 
When I finished the master’s degree I felt excited because the subjects were complicated.
I remember that I had to study for many hours after work. It was really difficult. I don’t recommend to work and study. You don’t have any time. when I finished my master’s degree. 
I was very happy. That was the best for me, specifically the day of my graduation. This event was interesting because the ceremony was amazing.
Many people attend the ceremony. I invited my girlfriend and my parents. My parents gave me a beautiful gift. In addition, I received a certificate in data analytics.
then, We ate dinner with my family. The dish was delicious. Additionally, I decided to dance. The girls at the event were very beautiful. 
I remember that I danced with a girl. it was a nice experience in my life. This day was special for me for many reasons. I think is an important milestone in my life. 
My dream is to work in a big company around the world. Probably this dream is hard but I never give up.
